Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch


qdapRegex 0.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `pastex` would throw a warning on a vector (e.g., `pastex(letters)`).  This 
  has been fixed.

* `youtube_id` was documented under `qdap_usa` rather than `qdap_supplement` and
  contained an invalid hyperlink.  This has been fixed.

NEW FEATURES

* `is.regex` added as a logical check of a regular expression's validy (conforms 
  to R's regular expression rules).

* `rm_postal_code` added for removing/extracting/replacing U.S. postal codes.

* Case wrapper functions, `TC` (title case), `U` (upper case), and `L` (lower 
  case) added for convenient case manipulation.

MINOR FEATURES

* `last_occurrence` regex added to the `regex_supplement` dictionary to find the
  last occurrence of delimiter.

* `word_boundary`, `word_boundary_left`, and `word_boundary_right` added to
  `regex_supplement` dictionary to provide a true word boundary.  Regexes 
  adapted from: http://www.rexegg.com/regex-boundaries.html#real-word-boundary

IMPROVEMENTS

* The `regex_usa` dictionary regular expressions: `rm_hash`, `rm_tag`, and
  `rm_tag2` pick up grouping that allows for replacement of individual sections 
  of the substring.  See `?rm_hash` and `?rm_tag` for examples.

CHANGES


qdapRegex 0.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

CRAN fix for oldrel Windows.  Updated to R version 3.1.0 in Description file.

NEW FEATURES

* `bind` added as a convenience function to add a left and right boundary to 
  each element of a character vector.


qdapRegex 0.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

First CRAN Release

NEW FEATURES

* `rm_citation` added for removing/extracting/replacing APA 6 style in-text 
  citations.

* `rm_white` and accompanying family of `rm_white` functions added to remove 
  white space.

* `rm_non_ascii` added to remove non-ASCII characters from a string.

* `around_` added to extract word(s) around a given point.

* `pages` and `pages2` added to the `regex_supplement` data set for 
  removing/extracting/validating page numbers.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `rm_XXX` family of functions now use `stringi::stri_extract_all_regex` as this 
  approach is much faster than the 
  `regmatches(text.var, gregexpr(pattern, text.var, perl = TRUE))` approach.
