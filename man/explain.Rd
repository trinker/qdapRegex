\title{Visualize Regular Expressions}
\usage{
explain(
  pattern,
  open = FALSE,
  print = TRUE,
  dictionary = getOption("regex.library")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{A character string containing a regular expression or a
character string starting with \code{"@"} that is a regular 
expression from a \pkg{qdapRegex} dictionary.}

\item{open}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the default browser will attempt to 
open \url{https://www.regexper.com} page.  Setting \code{open = 2} will 
utilize an unstable visualization via \url{https://www.debuggex.com}.  This 
approach utilizes a non-api scrape that is subject to change and not 
guaranteed to be stable.  The regex is set to Python flavor which handles 
lookbehinds that the Java based \url{https://www.regexper.com} does not.  This
functionality was developed by 
\href{https://www.matthewflickinger.com}{Matthew Flickinger} (see 
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/a/27574103/1000343} for details).  Note that 
the user must have \pkg{httr} installed or will be prompted if the package
cannot be \code{\link[base]{require}}d.}

\item{print}{logical.  Should \code{explain} print output to the console?}

\item{dictionary}{A dictionary of canned regular expressions to search within.}
}
\value{
Prints \url{http://rick.measham.id.au/paste/explain} to the console,
attempts to open the url to the visual representation provided by
\url{https://www.regexper.com}, and invisibly returns a list with the URLs.

\description{
Visualize regular expressions using \url{https://www.regexper.com} &
\url{http://rick.measham.id.au/paste/explain}.
}
\details{
Note that \url{https://www.regexper.com} is a Java based regular 
expression viewer. Lookbehind and negative lookbehinds are not respected.
