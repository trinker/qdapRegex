[qdapRegex](http://trinker.github.com/qdapRegex_dev) is a collection of regular expression tools associated with the **qdap** package that may be useful outside of the context of discourse analysis.  Tools include removal/extraction/replacement of abbreviations, dates, dollar amounts, email addresses, hash tags, numbers, percentages, citations, person tags, phone numbers, times, and zip codes.


The **qdapRegex** package does not aim to compete with string manipulation packages such as [**stringr**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html) or [**stringi**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/index.html) but is meant to provide access to canned, common regular expression patterns that can be used within **qdapRegex**, with **R**'s own regular expression functions, or add on string manipulation packages such as **stringr** and **stringi**.

The functions in **qdapRegex** work on a dictionary system.  The current implementation defaults to a United States flavor of canned regular expressions.  Users may submit proposed region specific regular expression dictionaries that contain the same fields as the [`regex_usa`](http://trinker.github.io/qdapRegex/regex_usa.html) data set or improvements to regular expressions in current dictionaries. Please submit proposed regional regular expression dictionaries via: https://github.com/trinker/qdapRegex/issues

## Educational

The **qdapRegex** package serves a dual purpose of being both functional and educational.  While the canned regular expressions are useful in and of themselves they also serve as a platform for understanding regular expressions in the context of meaningful, purposeful usage.  In the same way I learned guitar while trying to mimic Eric Clapton, not by learning scales and theory, some folks may enjoy an approach of learning regular expressions in a more pragmatic, experiential interaction.  Users are encouraged to look at the regular expressions being used ([`?regex_usa`](http://trinker.github.io/qdapRegex/regex_usa.html) and [`?regex_supplement`](http://trinker.github.io/qdapRegex/regex_supplement.html) are the default regular expression dictionaries used by **qdapRegex**) and unpack how they work.  I have found slow repeated exposures to information in a purposeful context results in acquired knowledge.  

The following regular expressions sites were very helpful to my own regular expression education:

1. [Regular-Expression.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html)    
2. [Rex  Egg](http://www.rexegg.com/)    
3. [Regular Expressions as used in R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/regex.html)    
4. [Debuggex (Visualizing Regex)](https://www.debuggex.com)    

Being able to discuss and ask questions is also important to learning...in this case regular expressions.  I have found the following forums extremely helpful to learning about regular expressions:

1. [Talk Stats](http://www.talkstats.com/)  +  [Posting Guidelines](http://www.talkstats.com/showthread.php/14960-Forum-Guidelines-Smart-posting-behavior-pays-off)    
2. [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)  +  [Posting Guidelines](http://trinker.github.io/stackoverflow/)

## Installation

To download the development version of qdapRegex:

Download the [zip ball](https://github.com/trinker/qdapRegex/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/trinker/qdapRegex/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install the development version:
```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/qdapRegex")
```

library(qdapRegex)
```

### Extract Citations
```{r}
w <- c("Hello World (V. Raptor, 1986) bye",
    "Narcissism is not dead (Rinker, 2014)",
    "The R Core Team (2014) has many members.",
    paste("Bunn (2005) said, \"As for elegance, R is refined, tasteful, and",
        "beautiful. When I grow up, I want to marry R.\""),

    "I always consult xkcd comics for guidance (Foo, 2012; Bar, 2014).",
    "Uwe Ligges (2007) says, \"RAM is cheap and thinking hurts\""
)

rm_citation(w, extract=TRUE)
```

### Extract Twitter Hash Tags, Name Tages, & URLs

```{r}
x <- c("@hadley I like #rstats for #ggplot2 work.",
    "Difference between #magrittr and #pipeR, both implement pipeline operators for #rstats:
        http://renkun.me/r/2014/07/26/difference-between-magrittr-and-pipeR.html @timelyportfolio",
    "Slides from great talk: @ramnath_vaidya: Interactive slides from Interactive Visualization
        presentation #user2014. http://ramnathv.github.io/user2014-rcharts/#1"
)

rm_hash(x, extract=TRUE)
rm_tag(x, extract=TRUE)
rm_url(x, extract=TRUE)
```

### Extract Bracketed Text

```{r}
y <- c("I love chicken [unintelligible]!", 
    "Me too! (laughter) It's so good.[interrupting]",
    "Yep it's awesome {reading}.", "Agreed. {is so much fun}")

rm_bracket(y, extract=TRUE)
rm_curly(y, extract=TRUE)
rm_round(y, extract=TRUE)
rm_square(y, extract=TRUE)
````

### Extract Numbers

```{r}
z <- c("-2 is an integer.  -4.3 and 3.33 are not.",
    "123,456 is a lot more than -.2",
    "hello world -.q")
rm_number(z)
rm_number(z, extract=TRUE)
```
